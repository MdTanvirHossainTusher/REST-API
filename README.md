# REST-API Testing


## Problem Statement

In this project, I send some GET and POST requests on this [website](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). Here, I validated USER'S and POST'S data given by the REST API as a responds. After that I store those data to check whether the responds was accurate as per requirements. Finally, I validated that responded data with TestNG.


## Build and Run

1. Clone git repository - `git clone https://github.com/MdTanvirHossainTusher/REST-API.git`.

2. Build the `pom.xml` file. If any dependencies requires updated version, then go to [this website](https://mvnrepository.com/). Search for those particular dependencies and update the dependencies
   version no.

3. Run the testcase.
